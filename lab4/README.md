# Lab 4 — Comprehending Phishing

**Objective:** Learn what phishing is, recognise common phishing signs, analyse sample messages, and write a short report.

## Tasks
1. Read short examples (in `examples/`).
2. For each example write red flags and explanation (in `analysis/`).
3. Check link/domain info (using `whois`, `dig`, `openssl` commands — optional).
4. Write final report `analysis/report.md`.

## Files
- `examples/` — sample phishing emails (text files).
- `analysis/` — analysis notes and final report.
- `screenshots/` — optional screenshots.

**Safety:** Use only the sample files here. Do not send them to real people.
