# Lab 4 Report â€” Phishing

## What is phishing (short)
Phishing is when attackers pretend to be a trusted service to trick people into giving secret information.

## What we did
- Created 2 sample phishing messages in `examples/`.
- For each sample we listed red flags and explained how to spot them.

## Key signs of phishing (short checklist)
- Strange sender address (domain does not match brand)
- Bad grammar or spelling
- Links with unusual domains or numbers
- Urgent or threatening language
- Requests for passwords or private data via email

## Recommendations
- Never enter credentials via links from email. Open the official site manually.
- Enable 2FA on accounts.
- Verify sender via another channel (phone, official app).
- Report suspicious emails to IT or the service.
