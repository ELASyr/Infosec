# Analysis for example_email_1.txt

**Red flags**
- Sender domain `support@paypaI.com` uses capital letter I instead of 'l' (visual spoofing).
- Link points to `paypa1-secure-login.com` (not official PayPal domain).
- Urgent language: "action required" to push user to click.
- No personal greeting (generic "Dear Customer").

**Explanation & advice**
- Never click links in suspicious emails. Hover to see real URL.
- Check sender email carefully (domain part after @).
- If in doubt, open site manually by typing official domain.
