# Lab 8 - Learning Vim Editor

## Overview
In Lab 8, I explored the Vim editor on Ubuntu WSL. Vim is a versatile and highly efficient text editor that allows editing without relying on a mouse. Learning Vim is essential for Linux users, cybersecurity practitioners, and anyone who wants to manage text files efficiently in a terminal environment.

## What I Did
I practiced:
- Installing Vim and navigating directories.
- Creating a text file and writing multi-line text.
- Using different Vim modes:
  - Insert mode (`i`) for typing text.
  - Normal mode for navigating and executing commands.
  - Command mode (`:`) for saving, quitting, and editing operations.
- Common commands like deleting lines (`DD`), copying (`yy`), pasting (`p`), undo (`u`), redo (`Ctrl+r`), and deleting all content (`:%d`).
- Saving (`:w`) and quitting (`:q`), or saving and quitting together (`:wq`).

## Key Takeaways
- Vim is keyboard-focused and allows rapid editing.
- Understanding different modes is crucial for effective use.
- Regular practice improves efficiency and comfort with terminal-based editing.
- Vim is widely available on Linux/Unix systems and is highly customizable.
