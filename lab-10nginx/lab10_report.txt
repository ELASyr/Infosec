Lab 10 - NGINX proxy_pass

Goal:
Set up NGINX as a reverse proxy to forward requests to a Flask API.

Setup:
- Flask app (app.py) runs on port 5000.
- NGINX listens on port 8000 and uses proxy_pass to send traffic to 127.0.0.1:5000.

Commands used:
sudo apt install nginx -y
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/my_api
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/my_api /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo nginx -t
sudo service nginx reload

Tests:
Backend (5000): $(curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:5000/hello 2>/dev/null || echo FAILED)
Proxy (8000):   $(curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:8000/hello 2>/dev/null || echo FAILED)

Result:
Both backend and proxy returned “Hello from Flask”.

Conclusion:
Nginx successfully forwarded requests from port 8000 to Flask on port 5000 using proxy_pass.
